        ABOUT WANDA MOBILE LIMITED: THE DIGITAL FARM SHOP
    </h4>
        <p>
            Wanda Mobile (WM) was born out of Wanda Organicâ€™s (WO) experience in servicing smallholder farmers in Kenya. The innovative distribution model managed by WM is based on direct feedback from the smallholders, and their expressed need for a package of services that recognize and respond to their circumstances. 
            Our 6 years of experience has shown that farmers want effective products, easy to use, convenient to access, affordable, consistent and reliable supply, from a company that they can trust and that offers customized post-sales technical support. 
            Leveraging mobile technology WM has taken these services closers to the farmers with a devolved hub and spoke model aimed at addressing last mile delivery gaps.
